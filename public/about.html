<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> Hello, My name is Autumn Espinosa. I am beginning my journey to become a full stack web developer. 
  I am blessed to have two amazing IOS engineer mentors that are knowledgable, supportive, and inspiring 
  when it comes to stay focused. 
</p>

<p> Growing up, I was raised in a suburban neighborhood with two loving parents who wanted me to become 
  something in life. 

</p>

<p> To be continued. </p>
