
<h1>The Best Movies According to Autumn</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies! </h2>
<hr />
<h3>Coraline </h3>
<p>This movie is not only entertaing, but it also teaches the viewers to be careful waht you wish for and appreciate what you have already. 
The film style is also very rarely seen in newer movies. It utilizes stop motion filming that requires many puppets and time. </p>
<h3>The Blair Witch Project</h3>
<p>A classic 1999 spooky documentary style horror movie. Who doesnt love a good spook?</p>
<h3>Avengers: Endgame</h3>
<p>As a closer to the Infinty Saga, this movie ultimately has to be in the top three list. A thriller that makes the watcher intriged and emotional at times.   </p>
